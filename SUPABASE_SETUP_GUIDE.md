# Supabase Setup Guide for E-Cell MNIT Website

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up your Supabase backend:

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose an organization
4. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: E-Cell MNIT Website
   - **Database Password**: Choose a strong password (save it!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
5. Click "Create new project" and wait ~2 minutes for setup

### 2. Get Your API Credentials

1. In your Supabase project, go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Find these values under "Project API keys":
   - **Project URL**: `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co`
   - **anon/public key**: `eyJhbGc...` (long string)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. In your project root (`d:\E-cell\Website`), create a file named `.env.local`
2. Copy the content from `.env.local.example` and replace with your actual values:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project. supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

3. Save the file

### 4. Set Up Database

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire content from `lib/supabase/schema.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" button
6. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

This creates:
- ✅ `team_members` table
- ✅ `events` table  
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Storage buckets for images
- ✅ Sample data (optional)

### 5. Create Your Admin Account

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard** (Recommended for production)
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Click "Add user"
3. Choose "Create new user"
4. Enter:
   - **Email**: your-admin-email@example.com
   - **Password**: Strong password (save it!)
   - **Auto Confirm User**: Enable this checkbox
5. Click "Create user"

**Option B: Via Signup Page** (Easier for development)
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/signup`
3. Fill in the signup form
4. You're automatically logged in!

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit:
- **Website**: http://localhost:3000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin
- **Login**: http://localhost:3000/admin/login

## 📋 Admin Panel Features

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" errors
- ✅ Check `.env.local` file exists and has correct values
- ✅ Restart dev server after adding environment variables
- ✅ Verify Supabase project URL is correct

### "Row Level Security" errors
- ✅ Make sure you ran the `schema.sql` file completely
- ✅ Check that RLS policies were created in Supabase Dashboard
- ✅ Verify you're logged in when trying admin operations

### Images not uploading
- ✅ Check storage buckets exist: `team-images` and `event-images`
- ✅ Verify buckets are set to "Public"
- ✅ Check storage policies allow authenticated users to upload

### Login not working
- ✅ Verify admin user was created properly
- ✅ Check email confirmation (if required)
- ✅ Try password reset if needed

## 🌐 Frontend Integration

The public pages automatically fetch data from Supabase:

**About Page** (`/about`)
- Displays team members from database
- Shows profile images from Supabase storage
- Includes social media links

**Events Page** (`/events`)
- Lists upcoming and past events
- Shows event images
- Displays registration links for upcoming events
- Automatic categorization

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
3. **Enable email confirmation** in production (Supabase Auth settings)
4. **Consider restricting signup** after creating admin accounts
5. **Review RLS policies** before going to production

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Add real team members** via admin panel
2. **Create your events** with dates and details
3. **Upload quality images** for events and team
4. **Test everything** works correctly
5. **Deploy to production** (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
